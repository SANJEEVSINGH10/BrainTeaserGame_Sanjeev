🧩 Picture Rebuild Brain Teaser Game By Sanjeev Kumar Singh – Website Overview

This is a simple browser-based puzzle game where the user uploads any picture (like a selfie or photo). The picture is automatically divided into square tiles and shuffled into a grid. Players must rearrange the tiles by dragging and dropping them back into the correct order to restore the original image.

The game includes:

📤 Upload feature – load any image from your device.

🔀 Shuffled puzzle grid – image is cut into equal pieces and randomized.

⏳ 3-minute countdown timer – challenge to solve within the time.

✅ Auto-check – instantly detects when the puzzle is solved and shows a success message.

It’s a fun, lightweight, and interactive web game that runs entirely in the browser without needing a server.
